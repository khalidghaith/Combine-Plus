# Combine+
Combine+ is a PDF merging and managing software developed by Khalid Ghaith using Gemini

1. INTERFACE & THEMES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application is designed with a clean, responsive interface using the Segoe UI 
font family. It supports two distinct visual themes to suit your environment:

* Light Theme (Default):
  - Features an off-white background with high-contrast text.
  - Uses a vibrant Orange accent for selections and active states.
  - Ideal for bright working environments.

* Dark Theme:
  - Features a deep gray background for reduced eye strain.
  - Retains the Orange accent adapted for dark mode visibility.
  - Perfect for low-light conditions.

2. ADDING & MANAGING FILES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Combine+ makes it easy to organize your documents and images before combining 
them.

* Importing Content:
  - Drag & Drop: Drag files directly from your computer into the app window.
  - Paste Files: Copy files from your file explorer and paste them into the app 
    (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V).
  - Paste Screenshots: Take a screenshot to your clipboard and paste it directly 
    to add it as a new item.

* Selection:
  - Click an item to select it.
  - Hold 'Ctrl' (or 'Cmd') to select multiple individual items.
  - Hold 'Shift' to select a range of items.
  - Selected items are highlighted with an orange border.

* Rearranging Files:
  - Drag & Drop: Click and drag items to move them. Look for the orange 
    "Insertion Markers" (lines) that indicate where the item will be placed.
  - Drop Tail: To move items to the very end of the list, drag them to the 
    dedicated area at the bottom of the window.

* List View Management:
  - Toggle between Grid and List views to suit your preference using the 
    top right toggle or pressing 'Tab' on the keyboard.
  - In List View, items may have expandable sections. Click to reveal more 
    details about the file.

3. THE VIEWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The built-in Viewer allows you to preview your files without opening external 
applications.

* Previewing: double click an item to display it in the viewer pane.
* Navigation: Use on-screen controls to flip through pages of a PDF.
* Zoom: Adjust the view size for better readability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

Speed up your workflow with these hotkeys:

* General:
  - Ctrl + V (Cmd + V): Paste files or images from clipboard.
  - Ctrl + A (Cmd + A): Select all items.

5. FEATURES & TRICKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Compressed State:
  - Some items may enter a "Compressed State" (appearing slightly smaller and 
    desaturated). This usually indicates an item is being processed, disabled, 
    or is in a specific mode awaiting user action.

* Modals:
  - Settings and specific actions may appear in a centered popup window (Modal).
  - Clicking the backdrop (the dimmed area outside the modal) typically closes it.
